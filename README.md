# github_rtm_scraper_with_s3

The project involves developing a web scraper for the properties available for rent on the website https://www.rightmove.co.uk/. This scraper is built using Python and the Scrapy framework. The script is deployed and executed on Heroku, and the resulting daily .csv files are stored in an AWS S3 storage bucket. The next phase of the project will focus on automating the data cleaning process and creating an analytics dashboard.
